This files are for Saber Interactive qa junior public test assignement

The assignement is 

Write a calculator in Python/JS/TS that takes a math expression as input.
For example:
> 2+2*5
> 12

I chose python to complete this assignement

PythonScriptEval is python script that uses "eval" function to complete assignement 
PythinScriptFunction is python script that uses function that is written without using eval

Source code is duplicated in txt files that have the same name as python variants with "TxT" in the end
